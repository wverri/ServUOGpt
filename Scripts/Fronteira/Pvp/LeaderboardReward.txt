Leaderboards, introduced with verions 1.5.0.0 keeps track of the leaders for each fight type. By default,
the leaderboard resets every 30 days, on the 1st of each month. If you would like to add your own custom
rewards without editing the code, you can use your own event sink. Below is an example of how that can be
done.

using System;

public class CustomLeaderboardReward
{
	public static void Initialize()
	{
		TournyEventSink.OnLeaderBoardReset += EventSink_LeaderboardReset;
	}

	public static void EventSink_LeaderboardReset(LeaderBoardResetEventArgs e)
        {
            foreach (var fighter in e.Team.Fighters)
            {
                var reward = new BodySash();
                reward.Name = string.Format("{0} Champion [{1}] for {2}", ArenaHelper.GetFightType(e.FightType), ArenaHelper.GetTeamType(e.Team.TeamType), LeaderStats.FormatHistoricLeaderBoardByMonthYear(DateTime.Now));

                if (!fighter.AddToBackpack(reward))
                {
                    fighter.BankBox.DropItem(reward);
                }

                fighter.SendMessage("You have recieved a special reward!");
            }
        }
}
